# Hangman Game

This project is a Java-based version of the classic Hangman Game with user interface using Swing. I made it since I decided to take a more fun approach to my projects, it was a good way to practice GUI development and Java programming. It features random word selection, a body part added every incorrect guess, and pop-up when the game ends either congratulating the player or telling them what the right word was.

## How It Was Made
This project was built using Java Swing for the GUI, with 2 separte files, Hangman.java for the game logic and HangmanGUI.java for the GUI. I used Java Collections (HashSet, Arrays) to track guessed letters and manage word. Java 2D Graphics to draw the Hangman figure, and SwingUtilities & Event Listeners for the user input and updating the interface.

## Future ideas
1. Longer list of words
2. Restart button after each round
3. Better UI with more fun colors
4. Hints as to what the word may be
